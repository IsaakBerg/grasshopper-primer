> Grasshopper is a graphical algorithm editor which integrates into Rhino’s 3-D modeling tools.  It allows designers to build dynamic form generators from the simple to the awe-inspiring.

###WELCOME
You have just opened the third edition of the Grasshopper Primer. This primer was originally written by Andrew O. Payne of Lift Architects for Rhino 4 and Grasshopper version 0.6.0007. That software had already advanced beyond a robust platform, yet Rhino 5 and Grasshopper 0.9.0076 have more to offer us now. To ease the learning curve, we now offer this updated and web-based primer for the use of Grasshopper community members.

Starting with an strong foundation, our team at [Mode Lab](http://modelab.is) worked on the look and feel of the third edition. This primer discusses the latest version of Grasshopper, highlighting its latest, most exciting improvements. The text, graphics, and examples intend to teach visual programming to the absolute beginner. Latter sections provide an introduction to Generative Design work-flows for the seasoned veteran. It is our goal that this primer serves as a field guide for new and existing users of  Grasshopper in their creative practice.

This primer introduces you to the fundamental concepts and
essential skill-building work-flows to effectively use Grasshopper. Foundations
is the first volume in a forthcoming collection of Grasshopper primers. Here's what you can expect to learn from the primer:
* **Introduction** - What is Grasshopper and how is it used?
* **Hello Grasshopper** - Make your first definition
* **Anatomy of a Grasshopper Definition** - What makes up a definition?
* **Building Blocks of Algorithms** - Start simple and build complexity
* **Designing with Lists** - What's a list and how do I manage them?
* **Designing with Data Tree** - What's a data structure and what do they mean for my process?
* **Appendix** - References and Working files for continued exploration

We hope this primer inspires you to explore the possibilities of programming with Grasshopper. We wish you the best of luck as you embark on this journey.

### THE GRASSHOPPER PRIMER PROJECT

The Grasshopper Primer is an open source project, initiated by Bob McNeel, Scott Davidson, and the Grasshopper Development team at [Robert McNeel & Associates](http://www.en.na.mcneel.com/).

**Mode Lab** authored the Third Edition of the primer. http://modelab.is

### ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
A special thanks to David Rutten for the endless inspiration and invaluable
work pioneering Grasshopper. We would also like to thank Andrew O. Payne
for providing the assets from which this work initiated. Huge thanks to Bob McNeel and everyone at Robert McNeel & Associates for their generous support over the years.

### REQUIRED SOFTWARE
**Rhino5**

Rhino 5.0 is the market leader in industrial design modeling software. Highly
complicated shapes can be directly modeled or acquired through 3D digitizers.
With its powerful NURBS based engine Rhino 5.0 can create, edit, analyze, and
translate curves, surfaces, and solids. There are no limits on complexity, degree,
or size.

**Grasshopper**

For designers who are exploring new shapes using generative algorithms,
Grasshopper is a graphical algorithm editor tightly integrated with Rhino’s
3D modeling tools. Unlike RhinoScript or Python, Grasshopper requires no
knowledge of the abstract syntax of scripting, but still allows designers to build
form generators from the simple to the awe inspiring.
