### 1.1.1. INSTALLING AND LAUNCHING GRASSHOPPER

#####The Grasshopper plugin is updated frequently so be sure to update to the latest build.
#####Note that there is currently no version of Grasshopper for Mac.


####1.1.1.1. DOWNLOADING
To download the Grasshopper plug-in, visit the Grasshopper web site. Click on
the *Download* tab at the top of the page, and when prompted on the next
screen, enter your email address. Now, right click on the download link, and
choose *Save Target As* from the menu. Select a location on your hard drive
(note: the file cannot be loaded over a network connection, so the file must
be saved to a hard drive local to your computer) and save the executable file
to that address.

>Download Grasshopper from the [grasshopper3d.com](http://grasshopper3d.com)
website.


####1.1.1.2. INSTALLING
Select *Run* from the download dialog box or double-click on the file and
follow the installer instructions. (*Note: you must have Rhino 5 already
installed on your computer for the plug-in to install properly*).

>Follow the steps in the Installation wizard.

####1.1.1.3. LAUNCHING
To launch Grasshopper, type *Grasshopper* into the Rhino Command line. If
Grasshopper is installed correctly, the first thing you will see is its splash
screen showing a progress bar while it finishes loading. Once Grasshopper
launches, the next thing you will see (*after the splash screen disappears*) is
a new window floating in front of Rhino. This window is Grasshopper's User
Interface (UI) within which you can create node-based programs to automate
various types of functionality in Rhino. Best practice (*if you have a large
enough screen or more than one screen*) is to arrange the windows so that they
do not overlap and Grasshopper does not obstruct the Rhino viewports. *If your
setup does not allow this, the Remote Control Panel may help (see 1.1.3.6).*

line while Grasshopper prepares to open its UI.

>Split the screen so that Grasshopper does not obstruct the Rhino Viewports.
You can do this by dragging each window to opposite sides of the screen, or if
on Windows 7 or higher (*or with Aerosnap running*) by holding the Windows key
and pressing the left or right arrows.
